## ADR-001: Cursor workflow rules

**Date:** 2026-06-08

**Context:** Need a disciplined, phase-based AI development workflow for this repository.

**Alternatives:**

1. Single monolithic `.cursorrules` file
2. Modular `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with scoped activation
3. `AGENTS.md` only

**Selected:** Modular `.mdc` rules + `AGENTS.md` orchestration.

**Rationale:** `.mdc` supports `alwaysApply` and intelligent activation; rules are version-controlled and shareable; `AGENTS.md` provides a single entry point without extra token cost.
